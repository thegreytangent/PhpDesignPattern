# PHP Design Pattern with Composer

## Introduction

Hi (-: this repository showcases the PHP Design Patterns that I've implemented, bundled with the convenience of Composer. Design patterns provide a standard solution to common problems in software design. Each pattern acts like a blueprint that allows customization to solve a particular design problem in your code.

## Features

1. **Modern PHP Standards**: Utilizing the latest standards of PHP to ensure efficient and up-to-date code.
2. **Composer Integration**: Manage and auto-load the classes using Composer, making it easy to integrate into any project.
3. **Multiple Design Patterns**: A comprehensive list of various design patterns to guide and help in various scenarios.
4. **Extensible**: Built with extensibility in mind, allowing you to incorporate additional design patterns as you see fit.
5. **Well-documented**: Each pattern is accompanied by a thorough explanation and usage examples.
